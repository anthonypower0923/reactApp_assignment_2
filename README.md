# Assignment 2 - ReactJS app.

Name: Anthony Power

## Overview.

This repository contains a react app for viewing information on movies and tv shows. This app pull data from the TMDB API to populate the movies lists. This app uses node.js as a back-end JavaScript runtime environment. The app contains lists and individual details on the various shows and movies such as genre, runtime and cast.

### Features.
 
+ Added tv shows sections to view tv shows with a discover and worldwide trending section
  and relevant details relating to each show with the ability to add shows to a seperate show favourites
  list.

+ Added cast list to both movies and shows containing the actor name and character played as well as a link to view movies 	 or shows(for TV shows) they are credited in.

+ Added sections for movies and TV shows actors starred in. This is accessable from the cast list in either Movies or 
  TV Shows from the link in each actors credits section.

+ Added a similar Movies and Shows section respectively which can be accessed from a MUI button in each details page.

+ Added pagination for core pages which requires the fetch request to have an addidtional field for page number which 
  when changed calls the request for the new page. The pagination control is MUI's inbuilt pagination feature and is placed at the top left of all relevant pages.

+ Changed the review view size so it can closed by clicking outside the drawer when oppened. Previously the drawer took
  up the whole of the screen making it impossible to close.

## Setup requirements.

+ It is possible than when cloning the app that before starting the app it will look for firebase to be installed
  using the node package manager. This is due to a failed attempt to add authorization to the app. To install
  this use the following command "npm install firebase". (This step might not be necessary)
